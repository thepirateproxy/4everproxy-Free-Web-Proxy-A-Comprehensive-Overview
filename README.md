### Is 4everproxy Free Web Proxy Secure?

All connections between your browser and this web proxy are encrypted using SSL/TLS, ensuring a secure connection. In addition to HTTPS, all content viewed through the service is uniquely encrypted and inaccessible to anyone else during your session. This means that even if someone gains access to your browsing history, they cannot view the websites visited through the proxy due to the unique URLs generated for your session. Even when viewing non-secure HTTP websites, they are served back to you securely via HTTPS. You can enable the "Permanent URL" option to directly link to third-party websites viewed through the proxy.

While generally safe, there are still risks, including potential security vulnerabilities, data collection, and privacy concerns.

### Potential Issues When Using 4everproxy

**1. Poor Speed:**  
Even if you choose the nearest proxy server, the speed might be very slow. As a free service, there may not be sufficient funding to maintain and source high-quality IP resources.

**2. Disconnections:**  
Frequent disconnections can occur, which can be frustrating. You might need to switch to another server in a different location, requiring several attempts to find one that functions properly.

**3. Excessive Ads:**  
As a free service, ads are necessary to generate revenue. However, these ads can sometimes obstruct important information, making it easy to click on them accidentally.
